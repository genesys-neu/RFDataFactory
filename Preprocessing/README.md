### Preprocess the .mat files:
The dataset must be saved in the form of `.mat` files on the hard storage. For the `.mat` files to be readable by the DLFramework, each signal (transmission) must be resized to (1,L) as a vector of L complex values.

The `.mat` files containing transmissions need to be preprocessed to form the training/test partitions and calculate mean and standard deviation, that are used by the `DLFramework`. All the necessary inputs for the `DLFramework` are generated by running `preprocess.py`

The preprocessing step generates 4 pickle files:

1. `Partition.pkl`: Contains train/val/test partitions which are lists of paths to the corresponding `.mat` files.
2. `stats.pkl`: Contains information about the dataset including mean and standard deviation of the training set.
3. `label.pkl`: Contains a dictionary that associates each mat file with a device name (class name).
4. `device_ids.pkl`: Contains a dictionary that associates each device name with a class index.
