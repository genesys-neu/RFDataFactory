### Preprocess the .mat files:
The `.mat` files containing sub-examples need to be preprocessed to form the training/test partitions and calculate mean and standard deviation, that are used by the `ML_code`. All the necessary inputs for the `ML_code` are generated by running `pre_process_uav.py`

The preprocessing step generates 4 pickle files:

1. `Partition.pkl`: Contains train/val/test partitions which are lists of paths to the corresponding `.mat` files.
2. `stats.pkl`: Contains information about the dataset including mean and standard deviation of the training set.
3. `label.pkl`: Contains a dictionary that associates each mat file with a device name (class name).
4. `device_ids.pkl`: Contains a dictionary that associates each device name with a class index.
